Building Basics
===============

These building basics focus on level geometry only. There is no logic or game triggers here.

Texture operations are initiated in the 2D view, you can switch to 3D view when indicated, to see the texture change.

Textures
--------

Sidedefs
^^^^^^^^

A Linedef can have front and back textures for the x, y and sec planes. You can tell the front of a Linedef by the direction of the protruding pin in the middle of the Linedef.

The relation of the sidedefs are best illustrated with these poorly matching textures:
